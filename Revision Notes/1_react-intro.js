// * INTRODUCTION TO REACT

// * 1. What is React?

// Introductory video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3AkSS5hXMA

// * React is a JavaScript library for building fast and interactive user interfaces (UIs).
// * It lets you build complex UIs from smaller "pieces" of code (called "components"). 
// * Everything in a React is a component!
// Once you create a component, you can reuse it anywhere in your project.
// Your UI is written in JavaScript, which React then "translates" into HTML.
// * React is a JS *library* to help you build UIs, not a *framework* (i.e. a complete solution).
// However, it has become part of a large "ecosystem" of third-party packages...
// ... which, when used together, can help us build a complete solution.
// * React can also help you build Single Page Applications (SPAs).

// * 2. What is a SPA?

// A SPA is a website which stays in a single page, rather than muliple pages for different parts of the website.
// By using a SPA, you can change what is displayed on the page according to what the user wants to do...
// ... insead of navigating to different pages for different parts of the site.
// This means the SPA can change only what is needed with each user interaction, without needing to reload the page.
// In a more "traditional" website, navigating to a new page would mean serving a new page each time.
// By only changing what is needed, users' load times are much faster, and the server doesn't have to send unnecessary information.

// * 3. Why use React to build a SPA?

// * React is currently the most popular frontend JavaScript library.

// It was originally created by Facebook.
// It is extremely popular: used by companies like UberEats, Netflix, Airbnb, Dropbox and many many more.
// It is quite simple to read, and easy to use.
// It is highly reactive (hence the name!)... 
// ... You can get quick and satisfying responses to user interactions without reloading the page.
// (So it is good from a UX perspective).
// It is flexible and reusable, for example through the use of components (see above).
// It is fast, and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) friendly...
// ... by reducing page load times, your site can rank highly in search enging algorithms.
